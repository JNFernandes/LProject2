# LProject2

## Main overview of the project 

The objective of this project was to develop an application for a specific mock-up client by applying specific concepts of programming such as:
  - Oriented object Programming
  - Software engineering (artifacts development)
  - complexity algorithm analysis 


This project was done in a team of **6 elements**, in a agile methodology, more specifically, Scrum methodology. In this way, the project was divid into 4 sprints in which sprint, new requiremnts were imposed by the client. The management of the workload, such as tasks for each element/ unit works, was done with the help of Trello tool. 

## Business context 

There were many specifications that allowed us to develop the pretended work. In short words, the objective of this work was to develop a management system for vaccination process to give response to a specific outbreak such as COVID-19. It is worthwile to mention that this system was developed for a generic outbreak. The client was the DGG, a state-funded Portuguese healthcare

## Techonological requirements 
Some constraints were given to the project such as: 
  - application should be developed in Java using IntelliJ or NetBeans IDE
  - graphical interface to be developed in javaFX
  - follow the coding standards 
  - implementation of unit tests using JUnit 5
  - artifacts in SVG format
  - serialization to guarantee data presistence between two runs of the application
  
  
## Actors of the business context 
  - Administrator 
  - Receptionist
  - Center Coordinator
  - Nurse
  - SNS User
  - "Auto" Clock/Timer

- US18: As a center coordinator, I want to get a list of all vaccines

The US10, US14 and US16 were the ones developed by me, thus the only artifacts in this repository presented
